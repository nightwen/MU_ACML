### Assignment 1: Backpropagation

We  implement  the  backpropagation  algorithm  for artificial  neural  networks,  and  apply  it  to  a  simple  synthetic classification  problem.  Our  implementation  achieves  an  optimal encoding  with  a  modest  training  time  of  only  50  epochs.

### Assignment 2: Convolutional Autoencoders

We use the Keras framework to create a more complex convolutional autoencoder model, and successfully apply it to image data. We explore the impact of different architectures. Finally, we try to apply our model to an image colorization problem.

### Assignment 3: Reinforcement Learning

We implement a Q-learning algorithm to solve the mountain car reinforcement learning problem. We observe good and robust results with a relatively simple implementation.

### Paper review

We review a prominent NeurIPS paper by researchers from DeepMind and the University of Berkeley, where they introduce a new reinforcement learning algorithm, _Stochastic Latent Actor-Critic (SLAC)_. Their main contribution is to split the learning process into representation learning and task learning, thereby strongly improving performance.
